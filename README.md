# Final Lab - Lab 4 
Combining all the techniques from the semester, I decided to work on Option B. 

I created a scene with the terrain tool of the following objects: forest (with lots of trees), mountains, and snow. I also implemented wind and weather effects. 

Attached is my Unity file, Lab Guide, and Report.
