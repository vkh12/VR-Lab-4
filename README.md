# Final Lab - Lab 4 
Combining all the techniques from the semester, I decided to work on Option A. 

I created a first-person controlled character with a wand, where there are two unique spells controlled by the palyer. Basic landscape and texture were implemented into the scene. 

Attached is my Unity file and Lab Guide.
